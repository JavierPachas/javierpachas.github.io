# Javier Pachas – Personal Site

This repository contains the source for my personal landing page hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript to keep things fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

## Highlights
- **Hero & About** – quick overview of current AI/ML work, with multilingual support.
- **Education & Skills** – concise snapshots of academic background and technical stack.
- **Contact** – direct links for email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavierPachas/javierpachas.github.io.git
cd javierpachas.github.io
python3 -m http.server 4000
```
Visit `http://localhost:4000` to preview changes.
